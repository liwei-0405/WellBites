# WellBites - AI-Powered Nutrition App 🍏

WellBites is a Flutter-based mobile application that uses AI to analyze food images and provide nutritional information. This project integrates Firebase for authentication, storage, and database management.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/liwei-0405/WellBites
cd wellbites
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```sh
flutter pub get
```

### **3️⃣ Configure Firebase**
#### 🔹 **If you're a contributor**
Firebase configuration files (`firebase_options.dart`) are **ignored in this repository** for security reasons. You need to generate your own Firebase configuration:
```sh
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```
✅ **This will generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` and connect your Firebase project.**

1. The new owner should **create their own Firebase project** in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. They need to run:
   ```sh
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   This will generate `firebase_options.dart` with their own Firebase credentials.
3. If needed, provide them with your **Firestore Rules & Storage Rules** as a reference.

### **4️⃣ Run the App**
For Android:
```sh
flutter run -d android/YourDeviceName
```
For Web:
```sh
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🔥 Firebase Features Used
✅ **Authentication** (User Login & Signup)
✅ **Cloud Firestore** (Stores AI-calculated nutrition data)
✅ **Firebase Storage** (Stores uploaded food images)
✅ **Cloud Functions** *(Optional: AI Processing Backend)*
