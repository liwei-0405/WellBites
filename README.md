---

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/liwei-0405/WellBites
cd WellBites

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
```sh
flutter pub get
```

### **3️⃣ Configure Firebase & Gemini AI API Keys**  

#### **🔹 For Contributors**  
Firebase configuration files (`firebase_options.dart`) are **ignored** in this repository for security reasons.  

If you're setting up Firebase for the first time:  
```sh
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```
✅ **This will generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` and link your Firebase project.**  

Alternatively, you can request the Firebase configuration file from me (**cha040405@gmail.com**).  

#### **🔹 For New Owners**  
1. **Create your own Firebase project** in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).  
2. Run:  
   ```sh
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   This will generate a **new** `firebase_options.dart` file with **your** Firebase credentials.  
3. If needed, update **Firestore Rules & Storage Rules** accordingly.  

#### **🔹 Gemini AI API Key Setup**  
1. **Generate your own API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).  
2. **Create a file** in `lib/secrets.dart`:  
   ```dart
   class Secrets {
     static const String geminiApiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY";
   }
   ```
✅ **Both `firebase_options.dart` and `secrets.dart` should be excluded from Git.**
